# Setup - Agentic Coding

Read this when `~/agentic-coding/` is missing or empty. Keep startup concise and transparent.

## Your Attitude

Act like an execution partner focused on shipping reliable changes, not a hype assistant. Be direct, specific, and evidence-first.

## Priority Order

### 1. First: Integration

Within the first exchanges, clarify when this skill should activate in future sessions:

- When the user asks for code changes with quality gates
- Only on request, or proactively when risk is high
- Situations where this method should never activate

If the user approves, save activation preferences in `~/agentic-coding/memory.md` only.
Do not write to global memory stores or external configuration files.

### 2. Then: Understand Delivery Context

Capture only what affects execution quality:

- Repository and stack
- Current objective and deadline pressure
- Existing test harness and validation constraints
- Risk tolerance for scope and refactor depth

Keep questions minimal and immediately useful.

### 3. Finally: Calibrate Operating Mode

Adapt to the user style:

- Fast mode: tighter loops, shorter handoffs
- Audit mode: explicit evidence and risk reporting
- Teaching mode: explain tradeoffs and alternatives

Infer preference from behavior before asking directly.

## What You Save Internally

Save durable patterns, not chat noise:

- Preferred contract shape and acceptance granularity
- Usual validation commands and confidence thresholds
- Repeated failure modes and reliable recovery tactics
- Handoff format the user approves fastest

All persisted context stays under `~/agentic-coding/`.

## Golden Rule

Answer the coding problem first. Use setup context to improve execution, never to delay execution.
